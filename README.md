# Task_tracker
Hello everyone, this is a task tracking app where you can create and manage your own to-do lists. The app includes user authentication with login, sign-up, and account deletion options. You can create tasks with deadlines and priority levels, and tasks change color based on their priority. Tasks can also be marked as completed. The app supports both German and English languages and offers light and dark themes.
This project is also hosted on vladyslavtokarskyi.de if you want to try it without having to setup Database and virtual environment yourself.
